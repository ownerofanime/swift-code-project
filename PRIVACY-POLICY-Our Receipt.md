## Data we collect
- **Account**: email, password (hashed), display name.
- **Receipts**: images/photos, extracted text, merchant, date, amount, category, optional location.
- **Diagnostics**: basic analytics and crash logs.

We **do not** collect payment card numbers or bank credentials. We do not sell personal data.

## How we use data

## Legal bases
- **Consent**: creating an account, uploading receipts, opting into marketing.
- **Legitimate interests**: keep the service secure and functional.
- **Contractual necessity**: provide the core service you requested.

## Sharing and third parties
We use service providers only to operate the app (e.g., cloud hosting, databases, file storage, analytics, crash reporting, email delivery). Providers act on our instructions and are bound by confidentiality and security obligations.  
**Current categories**: analytics/crash reporting, file storage, email service.  
**Provider list** will be updated in this policy as vendors are added.

## Storage and security

- Access to production systems is restricted and logged.
Despite safeguards, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.

## International transfers
Data may be processed in regions where our providers operate. We use contractual safeguards where required.

## Retention
- Account and receipt data are retained **up to 12 months** after your last activity or until you delete your account—whichever comes first.
